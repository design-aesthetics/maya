notes: 
- styling is done either in the html classes or in  resources/css/app.css
- use client's website as main reference... if you need also use resources/css/app2.css

make sure you create the components at resources/views/components

when including component in page use @include('component.NAME')


when you're in doubt of where page reference routes/web.php

set up:
to get started, run 


install 
https://herd.laravel.com/windows
https://bun.sh
https://getcomposer.org


go to directory 

bun i
composer install
php artisan serve
