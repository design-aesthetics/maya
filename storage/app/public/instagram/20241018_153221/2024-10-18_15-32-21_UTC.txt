Two days after my Moxi treatment☀️🕶️
It’s crucial to prioritize sun protection, as your skin is in a vulnerable and healing state. Sunscreen is essential to shield your skin from harmful UV rays, preventing damage and supporting the recovery process. The Colorescience Flex SPF 50 is an excellent choice, offering not only broad-spectrum protection but also a touch of coverage to even out your skin tone. Its lightweight formula blends seamlessly into the skin, giving you a natural finish while safeguarding your complexion from potential sun damage. This step is key in maintaining the best results from your invasive skin treatments!
I’m using the shade fair🌟
