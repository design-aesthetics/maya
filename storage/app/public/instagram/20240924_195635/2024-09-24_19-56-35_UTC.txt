Zapping Away the Cherry Angioma Has Never Been More Easy. 🍒🧊

Cherry angiomas are harmless, small red spots that form from clusters of blood vessels near the skin’s surface. 

🤔 Though harmless, many choose to treat them for cosmetic reasons. Cryotherapy is a simple, effective option that freezes angiomas without scars or incisions.

🧊 Cryotherapy works by applying liquid nitrogen directly to the angioma, freezing the blood vessels inside. This causes the angioma to gradually shrink and disappear as the body naturally reabsorbs the treated tissue. 

❓ Unlike other treatments, cryotherapy is quick, minimally invasive, and has a fast recovery time—making it the ideal choice for those looking to restore their confidence without downtime.

👉 After the procedure, caring for the treated area is straightforward. Gently wash with fragrance-free soap, apply Vaseline or Aquaphor to prevent crusting, and avoid makeup or scented lotions until the skin heals. 

🔄 Keep the area uncovered, and if any bleeding occurs, apply pressure to stop it. Sunscreen is a must post-treatment to prevent any scarring or discoloration.

✅ While Cryotherapy is suitable for most, those with heart issues or high blood pressure should consult a doctor. With proper aftercare, your skin heals in 7 to 10 days, leaving it clear and smooth. 

A blemish free skin is possible. Book a consultation and have our experts take a look at your skin. 📲
