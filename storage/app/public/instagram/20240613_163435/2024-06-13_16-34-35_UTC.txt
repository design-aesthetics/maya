Considering dermaplaning for clearer skin with acne? 

Here’s why it might be a smart move. 👍

Dermaplaning, which gently removes dead skin cells and peach fuzz using a surgical scalpel, can be a game-changer for minimizing breakouts. 💯

But here’s the catch— how you get it done matters 

In the comfort of the home, the mistakes people make is dermaplaning over active acne which only leads to further irritation and bacteria spread. 

Dermaplaning is best suited for when your acne has cleared up. This exfoliating method particular helps to stimulate new cell turn over to improve acne. 

For those with mild, non-inflamed acne or occasional small pimples, dermaplaning might still be an option to improve skin texture and prevent future issues. 

Always consult a skincare professional to ensure dermaplaning is suitable for your skin type and condition.
