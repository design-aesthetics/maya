Friendly Reminder💬

This is a kind reminder to all the lovely clients that Lia will be away from the office from July 19th to August 6th ! Appointments with our fabulous esty would be unavailable during these days.

However, The Maya Aesthetics team will still be open and available! if you'd like an appointment meanwhile, don't hesitate to get in touch with the team to book an appointment with them! they are always here and ready to service you 🩵

If you need to reach me with urgent questions and concerns, I'd have my phone available, and will try to respond as fast as I can.

I'll get back to you as soon as I return, feeling refreshed and ready to dive back in. 

Thank you for your understanding and patience. You're the best! 🙏
