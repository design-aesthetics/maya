ðŸŒ€ The Neurotoxin Cycle Explained ðŸŒ€

Understanding the neurotoxin cycle is crucial for getting the most out of treatments like tox and Dysport. ðŸ’‰ 

After your injection, it takes about 3-14 days for the effects to start showing, with full results typically visible around 10-14 days post-treatment. The effects peak at around 4-12 weeks, giving you that smooth, relaxed, and wrinkle free appearance. 

If youâ€™ve had forehead tox, the area is typically at rest, showing no sign of folded skin. However, these results gradually fade as the neurotoxin wears off, usually around the 3-4 month mark.

ðŸ’¡ Injectable treatment cycles are often explained to clients during consultations to stop them from having unrealistic expectations such as expecting results overnight or being surprised when they start to fade. 

When you understand your treatment cycle, you can better plan for important events, ensuring your skin looks its best when it matters most.

Remember, consistency with your treatments is key. Knowing when to schedule your next session can help you maintain your look without any gaps. âž°
