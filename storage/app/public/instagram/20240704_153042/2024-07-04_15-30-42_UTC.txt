Get ready to Get Your Glow On !! 🔥☀️ 

👉 A glycolic acid peel is the ultimate summer facial you need. It's a type of chemical peel treatment that uses glycolic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA), to exfoliate and rejuvenate the skin. 

The treatment starts with a gentle cleanse, followed by an acetone solution to prepare the skin. A 20-70% glycolic acid solution is then applied for 2-5 minutes, before a neutralizing solution stops the peeling process. Finally, a soothing moisturizer hydrates and calms the skin. 

This facial uniquely removes damaged skin layers over 7-10 days, revealing smoother, even-toned skin. It's perfect for tackling melasma, acne, fine wrinkles, and enlarged pores. 

With concentrations ranging from 20-70%, you can customize your treatment so it’s not too harsh for your skin type. And the best part? Most of our clients experience a noticeable difference even after one treatment. 👍

Additionally, Maya Aesthetics offers advanced technologies, such as microdermabrasion and LED light therapy, to enhance the benefits of the glycolic facial and provide optimal results. ✨ 

Some minor side effects might include mild stinging, flaking skin, or temporary redness, but don't worry, these will fade quickly. 💯 

So, what are you waiting for? Book your glycolic acid peel appointment at Maya Aesthetics today and get ready to unveil your radiant summer skin. 👏👏
