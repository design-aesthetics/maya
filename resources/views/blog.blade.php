                            As you age, you start to lose certain essential building blocks (collagen and elastin). It is important to restore these building blocks to delay or repair ageing indicators such as nasolabial folds and jowls. This is where Morpheus8 comes in.

                        <h3>What is Morpheus8?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Morpheus8 is a novel microneedling treatment that has been designed to be more effective than other existing forms of microneedling treatments because it also promotes remodelling of dermal adipose tissue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Morpheus8, created by InMode Aesthetics, a pioneer in radiofrequency technology, is the only technology that combines radiofrequency with the microneedling process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Microneedling alone causes a healing response in which collagen production rises. Collagen boost is just the frosting on the cake with Morpheus8. This device causes tissue remodelling by infusing radiofrequency radiation around 4mm deep into the tissue, causing thickening and tightness.

                            Morpheus8 Post Care Tips
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            It's important to avoid makeup for at least 24 hours post-treatment because there is little downtime, cosmetics can be worn 1 to 2 days after the procedure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Expect micro lesions a few days after treatment and minor redness for up to a week, depending on treatment settings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Avoid direct sun exposure and moisturise the treated area. We suggest wearing decent, broad-spectrum sunscreen every day. Sunscreen not only protects your skin during your recovery period, but it also lessens your future risk of skin cancer, reduces wrinkles and protects your skin from premature ageing.
